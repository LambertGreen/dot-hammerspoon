-- Disabled packages
--
-- Hammersoon is no longer working with good performance as the registered browser
-- require('UrlRouter')
--
-- No longer using ShiftToBrackets because it is better to learn to touch type the brackets after all.
-- An issue with using it, was that often times I pressed Shift by mistake which resulted in spurious
-- brackets being inputted.  This was especially annoying in password input fields.
-- require('ShiftToBrackets')

-- Disabling the use of UrlRouter for the following reasons:
-- 1. It does not work when trying to use 2 Chrome profiles
-- 2. It does not work when trying to use 2 browsers i.e. Chrome and Chrome Beta
-- require('UrlRouter')

-- Disabling the Readline since the only thing
-- there is an attempt to add <ctrl-u> functionality,
-- and we are running into issues with that.
-- Fortunately macOS already has decent support
-- for Readline like bindings.

-- require('Readline')
