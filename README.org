#+TITLE: A =Hammerspoon= configuration.

* HyperMode
An alternative to using a =HyperKey=. Inspired by =Doom Emacs=/=Spacemacs= keybinds.

* ControlTapToEscape
This script helps facilitate using the =Capslock= key as combo key i.e. =Control= when used with another key, else =Escape= if tapped. It is expected that the system keyboard configuration option is used to rebind =Capslock= to =Control=.

* Brackets
Brackets are hard to type without ever making errors, so why not use those large =Shift= keys. Tapping =LShift= will output ~[~ and tapping =RShift= will output ~]~.

* TODOs
** TODO Update README with sections for other scripts
